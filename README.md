## Did you create these plugins?
**No!** I take absolutely no credit for these plugins, or their contents. I
only found them and committed them for safe keeping. Please refer to the
`Credits` section of this document and the commit history for more information.

## Why did you upload these plugins?
Entity appears to need these plugins in order to do neat things like view a
map's BSP. It took me a long time to find a copy of these files that worked and
appeared trustworthy.

## Did you modify these plugins?
Absolutely not. That said, I cannot prove that I did not modify them. There is
also no way to know if someone else modified them before I found them.

## Where did you get these from?
Please review the commit history of each plugin. The commit history will
represent anything and everything I know about the plugins.

## Hey! I wrote these!
If you wrote one or more of these plugins, I would be happy to give you credit
for it. Better yet, you should host these yourself so I do not have to. There
is no obvious copy right that I could find in any of the plugin files...
I think these plugins can be safely considered
[public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain).

## Credits to (possible) author(s)
